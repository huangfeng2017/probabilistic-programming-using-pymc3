# probabilistic-programming-using-pymc3
I read the article and learned something about probabilistic programming, besides, i tried to run all the examples in Python by using PyMC3, but there had some problems in the process of running, such as the model implementation and the fitting part of case study 1. Throughout the whole article, i cannot understand some of the details of the model and sampling algorithms well.     Lastly, i had to admit that PyMC3 provided a probabilistic programming platform for quantitative researchers to implement statistical models flexibly and succincctly, so that I will learn it futher in the future.
